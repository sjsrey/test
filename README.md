# This is the title
We are going to learn git today.

## Introduction
This is where we write the introduction.

Things to do in the introduction:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
2. Third thing.

## Links
You can do links like [this](https://github.com/sjsrey/204gh).

## Other formatting

To put things in **bold** you do that. To put in *italics* it is that.

This is in-line `code`

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

## What is the commit and status stuff?

I don't know, let's change the file in VSC and see.


## VSC and git
More stuff here. Can we do source control with VSC?

And more here.

# Remote Changes
I did this on github

# Local Changes
Yes that is cool. But I can also change it locally.
